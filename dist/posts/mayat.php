###Mayat, Nurick, Langa Inc

A simple one-page site for a law firm in Johannesburg
I was not responsible for the design of this.

**Notable features:**
* Usage of business-related [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) markup to improve SEO
* A simple CMS built on top of Laravel -- which I recognise is a bit crazy for a one page site.
