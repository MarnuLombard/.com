####Kainav Conservation Foundation
In the early parts of the build, but have a look at the [github repo here.](https://github.com/MarnuLombard/kainav)

**Notable features:**

*   A new build structure, finally fully seperating *src* and *dist*
*   Using [grunt.js](http://www.gruntjs.com) to automate my build process
*   Written to be hooked up to a database, ie. all sections are foreach( echo'ed) out from an array instead of static content
