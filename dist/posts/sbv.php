###SBV (Secure Banking Vehicle)
A corporate site for a large cash in transit company.

**Notable features:**

*   I built a custom CMS for them. Using PHP and Javascript I created a very simple- but very comprehensive CMS for client too use. Examples of this code is avaliable upon request
*   Just the standard best practices ([Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki/), etc)

[Live site](http://www.sbv.co.za/)"
