This is the redesign of my current employer's site.

**Notable features:**

*   Completely hi-res ready with SVGs and icon-fonts
*   A dynamically generated, database-driven gallery
*   An upload system for the gallery
*   The slider removes itself before the DOM loads or images download based screen size. (no display:none)
