A very large scale site for an NGO. The previous site has ~80 pages. (And was written in a table-based layout)

**Notable features:**

*   Massive databases, generating most of the site's content
*   A low-level CMS for the client to manage their own databases
*   Some crazy php and javascript functions
*   A PHP-based user forum
*   Using UserVoice to get feedback from the users while developing
